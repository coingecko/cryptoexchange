        is an automated strategy that buys when RSI and volatility is high, sells
        when RSI and volatility is low, and otherwise holds its current position.\n\nMoonshot
        was given its name due to the fact that attempts to join strong bull trends
        that are starting to break out.  This strategy does not try to catch every
        small-medium price swing.\n\nI expect Moonshot to potentially underperform
        a buy-and-hold strategy in strongly bullish and sideways/choppy markets and
        overperform in bearish markets.  This strategy is designed to win the long
        game by holding a long position during strong bull markets, selling when the
        trend looks to be breaking down, and then buying back at a discount after
        the bear trend ends.   This is the pronounced compounding effects that can
        be seen in the backtest data.  This strategy also produced much lower portfolio
        volatility that a buy-and-hold.\n\nETH Moonshot X uses the Moonshot algorithm
        with parameters that worked better with ETH in backtesting.\n\nDISCLAIMER:
        While this strategies backtesting results were very promising, it is important
        to understand that it has little live trading history.  By buying this set
        you are assuming the typical risk that is associated with any untested strategy.\n\nIf
        you would like a more technical explanation of how the Moonshot algorithm
        works please check it out at https://medium.com/@aaronkruger/the-moonshot-strategy-explained-41a25e63aff\n\nIf
